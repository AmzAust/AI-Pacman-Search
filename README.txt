My program successfully finds solutions for DFS, BFS, UCS, and A*.
It uses mostly the same algorithm to find each solution, the main
differences being use of Stack, Queue, and Priority Queue from
util.py. The frontier is also managed slightly differently when
it is required to calculate total costs of steps. I think the
comments in the code are fairly good for explaining what is going
on in the code. I also solved the corners problem and made heuristic
for the corners by using the manhattan distance method found in util.py.
I copied that method into searchAgents.py for my use. I was unable to
finish question 7 and 8 due to time constraints. I spent somewhere
between 20-25 hours working on this project. It was very challenging,
but also fun.

The files to look at are: search.py and searchAgents.py
